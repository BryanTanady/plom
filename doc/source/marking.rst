The marking process
===================

Once some of your papers have been scanned and uploaded, you can get
your marking team to start working.

.. tip::
    You do not need to wait until all papers are processed before starting.


Ready to mark
-------------

Your markers will all need to download the client: :doc:`getting_started`.

They can then begin the process of annotating papers, leaving useful
feedback and assigning marks (grades).
It is by far the most important part of the assessment, and will
consume the vast majority of your available person-time.
Individual markers can be assigned to a specific version of a specific
question.


Marking party!
--------------

Some people recommend that you and your term work at least initially
in the same physical location.
Of course, you can use Plom to do your marking just about anywhere,
but it has been observed that marking goes much faster and is more
consistent when you are all in the same location.
Once your marking scheme has been exposed to real student responses
and your team has worked out the kinks, physical proximity is less
important.


Tracking progress
-----------------

You can use manager accounts to keep an eye on progress on this whole process.

If you are using the older legacy server, see :doc:`manage`.


Assigning tasks to particular users
-----------------------------------

This is done by tagging the task for someone.  Find the task under
"Progress" -> "Task overview" and "Flag to user".


Reverting annotations
---------------------

Find the task described above, and click "reset".


Reassigning tasks to other users
--------------------------------


Occasionally you might need to check over the marking of one of your
users.
You can do this under the "Progress" part of the UI, where you can
search based on user name, or other criteria.
You can sort the results by score, marking time, when the marking was
done, etc.

To reassign a task, click on "Details" then "Flag to user", finally "reset".

.. caution::
    The new user will unfortunately not be able to see the previous
    annotations.  Reassigning tasks is work-in-progress.
