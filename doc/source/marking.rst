The marking process
===================

Once some of your papers have been scanned and uploaded, you can get
your marking team to start working.

.. tip::
    You do not need to wait until all papers are processed before starting.


Ready to mark
-------------

Your markers will all need to download the client: :doc:`getting_started`.

They can then begin the process of annotating papers, leaving useful
feedback and assigning marks (grades).
It is by far the most important part of the assessment, and will
consume the vast majority of your available person-time.
Individual markers can be assigned to a specific version of a specific
question.


Marking party!
--------------

Some people recommend that your term work at least initially
in the same physical location.
Of course, you can use Plom to do your marking just about anywhere,
but it has been observed that marking goes much faster and is more
consistent when you are all in the same location.
Once your marking scheme has been exposed to real student responses
and your team has worked out the kinks, physical proximity is less
important.


Tracking progress
-----------------

You can use manager accounts to keep an eye on progress.
If you are using the older legacy server, see :doc:`manage`.


Tagging tasks
-------------

Each task can be tagged with essentially arbitrary short text tags,
which are used to communicate within the grading team (they are not by
default shown to students).

Tagging it to a particular user will mean that Plom is more likely to
assign the task to that user.


Reassigning and reverting tasks
-------------------------------

You can find tasks under the "Progress" section of your Plom admin site.
There you can "reset" (revert all annotations made to a task) a task.
You can also assign it to another user, keeping existing annotations intact.

.. caution::
    Reassigning tasks is still work-in-progress.


Quotas
------

Sometimes you may wish to temporarily limit the numbers of questions a
user can mark.
You can do this by setting a per-user quota in the User Management
part of the Plom admin site.
After a marker reaches their quota, they will not be allowed to mark
additional papers, until you remove or increase their quota limit.

Examples of this feature include:

   1. You are working with novice graders and want to review their
      marking and/or meet with them after they have graded (say) 20
      tasks.
   2. You're working with team and want everyone to mark 10 tasks,
      then have a meeting to settle on a common set of rubrics.
   3. You have 300 tasks that need grading and want to strictly ensure
      that no one does more than their share.
