Plom "Legacy" API
-----------------

The "legacy" server also has an API, currently with considerable overlap,
although most of this should be considered deprecated and not all of it is
planned to be ported to the new server.
This page is autogenerated from our ``aiohttp`` route handler source code,
which is the current best-effort documentation of the client-server API.
