Installing the Plom Client
==========================

If you just need to use Plom to grade some papers then you only need the Plom Client.
This can be obtained in several ways:

* GNU/Linux users can install `from Flathub`_.
* Compiled binaries are available from our `releases page`_.
* Install from source or using `pip`.

.. _from Flathub: https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.plomgrading.PlomClient
.. _releases page: https://gitlab.com/plom/plom/-/releases/


For macOS
---------

Download the appropriate "Compiled client" for your version of macOS
from our `releases page`_.

The macOS client ships as a ``.zip`` file.  Open it and drag the ``.app``
bundle out onto your desktop or into your Applications folder.  You can
then delete the ``.zip`` file if you wish.

.. note::

    Unfortunately the .app is not “signed” which means you will likely
    get a security warning preventing you from opening it.  You may
    need to change something in “Privacy & Security” in “System
    Preferences”, see `Issue #1676`_ for details.

    .. _Issue #1676: https://gitlab.com/plom/plom/-/issues/1676


For Windows
-----------

Download the "Compiled client for Windows" from our `releases page`_.

Locate the ``.exe`` file on your computer and double-click on it.

(You may get warnings about unsigned files, but it should be possible to
continue.  You can check the md5sums in our `releases page`_ if you
want to verify your download.)


For GNU/Linux
-------------

Users of various distributions can install from `from Flathub`_.

.. _from Flathub: https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.plomgrading.PlomClient

Another option is to download the "AppImage" from our `releases page`_.

You may need to change the permissions on the binary to make it executable.
Open a terminal and go to the directory where you saved the binary::

  chmod +x PlomClient-x.y.z-x86_64.AppImage
  ./PlomClient-x.y.z-x86_64.AppImage
