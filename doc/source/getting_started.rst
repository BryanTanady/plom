Getting started with the Plom Client
====================================

So you want to use Plom to grade some papers?
You probably want to start with the Plom Client, which can be
obtained in several ways:

* GNU/Linux users can install `from Flathub`_.
* Compiled binaries are available from our `releases page`_.
* Install from source or using `pip`.

.. _from Flathub: https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.plomgrading.PlomClient
.. _releases page: https://gitlab.com/plom/plom/-/releases/

See :doc:`install-client` for more details, including a few caveats
and "gotchas".
