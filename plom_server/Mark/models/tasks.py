    ~~~~~~

    Inherited from the superclass, MarkingTasks also have a status:

      - `StatusChoices.TO_DO`: No user has started work on this task.
      - `StatusChoices.OUT`: Some user has this task signed out.  If they
        surrender the task later, it goes back to being TO_DO.
      - `StatusChoices.COMPLETE`: The task is finished.  However the
        new annotations associated with it could arrive: this is tracked
        via idea of the "Latest Annotation".
      - `StatusChoices.OUT_OF_DATE`: various actions could invalidate
        the work, such as removing a Page, or adding a new one.  In this
        case the task becomes out-of-date, in lieu of being deleted.
        It cannot transition back to earlier states.
        OUT_OF_DATE can still have a Latest Annotation.
