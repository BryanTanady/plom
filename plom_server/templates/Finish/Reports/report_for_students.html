        <h3>Student achievement by topic or learning objective</h3>
        <img src="data:image/png;base64,{{ pedagogy_tags_graph }}" />
        <p>
            Each question on this assessment was tagged by the instructor
            with a topic or learning objective. Above is a graph
            which indicates your mastery of the identified topic. The
            score for each label is calculated as a weighted average of
            the score on the associated questions.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, if Question 1 and Question 2 have the tag of
            <q>Learning Objective 1</q>, with scores of 4/10 and 8/10
            respectively, then the score for Learning Objective 1 is
            calculated as the weighted average of the scores on
            Questions 1 and 2: 1/2 (4/10+8/10) = 0.6.
        </p>
        <p>
            The labelling of questions is meant to help identify topics/areas
            of strength and topics/areas for review.  If the score on a
            topic is low, it is strongly recommended to review the associated
            lecture notes, the associated section in the textbook, and/or
            contact your instructor for an office hour.
