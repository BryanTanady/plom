Templates for Plom Tests
========================

These are example templates you can use for preparing a test or exam
for using with Plom.


Extra sheets
------------

Generally we recommend leaving lots of space on the page.  But if a
student runs out of space and needs extra paper, you can have them
write on any paper, just make sure its labelled with their student
number and ideally their Plom test number.  We provide an appropriate
template for this called `extraSheets.tex`.

Make sure you print it double-sided!
